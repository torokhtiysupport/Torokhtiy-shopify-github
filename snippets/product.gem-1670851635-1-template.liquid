Clean - while taking the bar to the shoulders, the athlete pulls it off the platform and lifts it to the shoulders. Then he half-squats and with a sharp movement sends the bar up to straight arms, at the same time squatting under it, spreading his legs slightly to the sides (Push Jerk) or back and forth (Split Jerk). After fixing the position of the bar above the head, the athlete straightens the legs, placing the feet parallel, holding the bar above the head.</p></div></div><div data-label="Heading" data-key="heading" data-atomgroup="element" id="e-1664554521082" class="element-wrap" data-icon="gpicon-heading" data-ver="2" data-id="1664554521082"><div class="elm text-edit gf-elm-center gf-elm-center-md gf-elm-center-sm gf-elm-center-xs gf-elm-center-lg" data-gemlang="en" data-exc=""><h2 class="gf_gs-text-heading-2">Benefits of Olympic Weightlifting for Women</h2></div></div><div data-label="Text Block" data-key="text-block" data-atomgroup="element" id="e-1664557078339" class="element-wrap" data-icon="gpicon-textblock" data-ver="1" data-id="1664557078339"><div class="elm text-edit gf-elm-left gf_gs-text-paragraph-1" data-gemlang="en"><p>A fit body, stronger bones, healthy joints as well as amazing coordination are just a few advantages that the female Olympic weightlifting program may provide. can offer a lot of benefits: a healthy body, strong bones, flexible joints, and good coordination.

Warming up improves joint mobility, muscle and nerve coordination, and increases metabolism. An increase in heart rate, an increase in body temperature is crucial. Proper warm-up helps open the capillaries in the muscles and thereby increase blood supply. Moreover, such an increase in body temperature reduces the viscosity of the muscles and increases their elasticity, protecting against possible sports injuries. It is also important to remember that the musculoskeletal system is not ready immediately after a warm-up for heavy loads. Give yourself 5-8 minutes after warming up before continuing.

The beginner's technique and the professional's technique have different criteria, amplitude and speed characteristics. Secondly, the strongest athletes in the world are often unique, one-of-a-kind people with their own unique body structure and movement techniques that a novice beginner does not have. In other words, a professional who has mastered his craft often adapts his technique to suit himself. What works for them may not work for someone else. Of course, you can and should watch and admire a unique athlete, just don't blindly copy someone else's technique. Imitating someone else does not move you forward as an athlete.

In practice, this often means that athletes first drive themselves into a state of overtraining, which can lead to injury. As a result, such overtraining can make further training impossible. Remember, you can't always be at the peak of your athletic performance. Such a load on your body will destroy you physically. Professional athletes work for months to reach this state to prepare for peak performance during competition, but after that, their training load is deliberately reduced to give the body time to recover. Also remember: improvement is not a straight line. Your personal results will go up, they will go down, and some weeks they will seem worthless. Don't lose hope. Know the limits of your body. Check them, but don't overdo it and don't forget to give yourself time to recover.</p><p><br></p></div></div></div></div>{% if gem_product_bak %}{% assign product = gem_product_bak %}{% endif %}<div style="display:none!important">{% if shop.metafields.gpGlobalConfigs.enableProductSchema == "true" or shop.metafields.gpGlobalConfigs.enableProductSchema == blank %}<script type="application/ld+json">{%- assign g_review_count = 0 -%} {%- assign g_rating_value = 0 -%}{%- comment -%}For Judge.me Reviews{%- endcomment -%}{%- if product.metafields.judgeme.badge -%}{%- assign product_review_array="data-number-of-reviews,data-average-rating"|split:',' -%}{%- capture review_data -%}{{product.metafields.judgeme.badge}}{%- endcapture -%}{%- assign array_builder="" -%}{%- for review_data_item in product_review_array -%}{%- assign review_data1=review_data|split:review_data_item -%}{%- assign review_data2=review_data1[1]|split:"=" -%}{%- assign review_data3=review_data2[1]|split:"'" -%}{%- assign review_data_value=review_data3[1]|plus:1|minus:1 -%}{%- assign array_builder=array_builder|append:review_data_value|append:'_' -%}{%- endfor -%}{%- assign review_data_array=array_builder|split:'_' -%}{%- assign g_review_count=review_data_array[0] -%}{%- assign g_rating_value=review_data_array[1] -%}{%- endif -%}{%- assign cv_schema = product.selected_or_first_available_variant -%}{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Product",{%- if g_review_count != 0 -%}"aggregateRating": {"@type": "AggregateRating","ratingValue": "{{ g_rating_value }}","reviewCount": "{{ g_review_count }}"},{%- endif -%}"name":{{product.title|json}},"url":{{shop.url|append:product.url|json}},{%- if product.featured_image -%}{%- assign image_size=product.featured_image.width|append:'x' -%}"image":[{{product.featured_image.src|img_url:image_size|prepend:"https:"|json}}],{%- endif -%}"description":{{product.description|strip_html|json}},{%- if cv_schema.sku!=blank -%}"sku":{{cv_schema.sku|json}},{%- endif -%}"brand":{"@type": "Brand","name":{{product.vendor|json}}},"offers":{"@type":"Offer","availability":"http://schema.org/{% if cv_schema.available %}InStock{% else %}OutOfStock{% endif %}","price":{{cv_schema.price|divided_by:100.00|json}},"priceCurrency":{{cart.currency.iso_code|json}},"url":{{shop.url|append:cv_schema.url|json}}}}</script>{% endif %}</div><script>window.__gemStoreData = {};window.__gemStoreData.gemKeyValid = {};window.__gemStoreData.gemKeyValid.bestWayAddToCart = 1;</script>
