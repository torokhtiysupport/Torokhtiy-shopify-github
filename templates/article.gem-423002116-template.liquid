<p><b>What to eat in order to lose weight? </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is an eternal question for all food lovers. It seems every person reaches that stage in life when it's time to start losing weight. At first everyone is excited to try their diet and exercise routine, going at it with all their energy and all their focus. But then time goes by, and the fat does not want to leave, and we get disappointed. As a result training becomes more and more complicated, because there is nowhere to take energy from the "diet".</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider the main mistakes that lead to weight gain, despite an intense training process:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">           </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">An improperly composed diet.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, athletes start with a reduction of carbohydrates and fats, leaving only protein in their diet, hoping for a large gain in muscle mass and better fat burning. Then, to their shock, those bulging muscles don’t appear! Calories are reduced, metabolism slows down, there is a desire to eat more, and your mood turns sour and you’re constantly angry. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the truth behind the myth: During a training session, your body needs a lot of energy, and the source of that is glucose. It is a very simple molecule of the carbohydrates class, but not protein. When ATP is generated in sufficient quantity and efficiently, the barbell is suddenly lifted more and more easily. For that reason porridge, sweet potato and pasta should always be a part of your workout diet.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">       </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of advertising, athletes often replace basic meals with “sports nutrition” – protein shakes or energy bars, hoping these will burn away the fat.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such products (especially gainers and bars) are quite high in calories, but they won’t properly fulfil your hunger. Okay, you've eaten a protein bar and did not feel it, even though almost 350 calories fell into your stomach. Instead, try a medium sized sandwich with turkey, avocado and vegetables, plus a glass of fresh juice and crackers. Perhaps it's not such a dense dinner, but for the same amount of calories, you won’t be feeling hungry for the next two hours!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s the truth: replacing real food with a "sports alternative" doesn’t do anything for you. It's another matter when time is short and you need to "throw something in the firebox". In that case, by all means reach for the energy bar or that protein shake. However, this should not be a routine substitute for the main meal, otherwise you’ll still feel hungry, you’ll eat more, and fat is guaranteed.</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">        </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The second law of thermodynamics hasn't been canceled yet.</span>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to stay in shape, you need to burn off as many calories as you take in. And, if you want to reduce weight, you need to have a deficit. In other words, you need to burn off more than you take in. Eat less, or train more, but maintain a healthy diet. Better yet, do all three. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One more thing to leave you with. If your goal is to gain both fat and muscle – you can lie on the couch sometimes, but not for too long. Remember, a body in motion tends to stay in motion, but a body at rest tends to get overweight!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Epilogue: So, what should you eat to lose weight? It’s not that simple. You need </span><b>to eat AND train right</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, otherwise your goal will forever remain out of sight.</span> </p>
